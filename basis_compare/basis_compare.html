      BASIS_COMPARE <br> Compare two basis sets.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BASIS_COMPARE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      compares the amount of overlap between two basis sets.
    </p>

    <p>
      In an <b>M</b>-dimensional space, a set of <b>N</b> orthonormal vectors
      <b>U</b> is provided, which span some subspace.  We let <b>Q</b> be the
      <b>M</b> by <b>N</b> matrix whose columns are an orthogonal basis for
      the span of the vectors <b>U(1:N)</b>.  (We'll assume for now that the
      vectors <b>U</b> are linearly independent.  Otherwise,
      <b>Q</b> could actually have fewer "interesting" columns than <b>U</b>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      One or more <b>M</b>-vectors <b>V</b> are then considered.  For each
      <b>V</b>, it is desired to know the proportion of the vector that lies
      within and outside the subspace spanned by <b>U</b>.  <b>V</b> admits an
      orthogonal decomposition of the form:
      <pre><b>
        V = V1 + V2
      </b></pre>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>V1</b> is a vector in the subspace spanned by <b>U</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>V2</b> is a vector orthogonal to the subspace spanned by <b>U</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          sqrt ( ||<b>V1</b>||^2 + ||<b>V2</b>||^2 ) = ||<b>V</b>||
          = Euclidean length of <b>V</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The values
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>ALPHA</b> = ||<b>V1</b>|| / ||<b>V</b>||
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>BETA</b>  = ||<b>V2</b>|| / ||<b>V</b>||
        </li>
      </ul>
      must lie between 0 and 1; their squares must sum to 1, and indicate
      the portion of <b>V</b> which lies within the <b>U</b> subspace, and
      the portion which lies in the orthogonal complement.  Equivalently,
      the angle <b>THETA</b> between <b>V</b> and the subspace is determined by
      <pre><b>
        TAN ( THETA ) = BETA / ALPHA.
      </b></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      To compute <b>ALPHA</b>, we realize that <b>Q' * V</b> produces the
      <b>N</b> by 1 vector of projection coefficients of <b>V</b> onto each
      <b>U(I)</b>.  Therefore, <b>V1</b>, the orthogonal projection of <b>V</b>
      into <b>U</b> is <b>Q * ( Q' * V )</b>:
      <pre><b>
        V1 =       Q * Q'   * V
      </b></pre>
      and the "remainder" is:
      <pre><b>
        V2 = ( I - Q * Q' ) * V
      </b></pre>
      from which we can determine <b>ALPHA</b> and <b>BETA</b>, and finally
      <b>THETA</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such sets are computed, for example, by
      <a href = "../cvt_basis_flow/cvt_basis_flow.html">CVT_BASIS_FLOW</a>,
      <a href = "../pod_basis_flow/pod_basis_flow.html">POD_BASIS_FLOW</a>,
      and
      <a href = "../svd_basis/svd_basis.html">SVD_BASIS</a>,
      However, somewhat inconveniently, these programs are working
      with velocities, and store each vector in a pair of columns.
      For now, we have set up the program to expect the input data
      to have this format.  Moreover, rather than comparing the
      two bases directly, we read in one basis to use as U, and
      then each vector of the other basis is checked against U.
      Also, U and V already consist of orthonormal columns, so
      the QR factorization of U is simply
      <pre><b>
        U = Q * R = U * I.
      </b></pre>
