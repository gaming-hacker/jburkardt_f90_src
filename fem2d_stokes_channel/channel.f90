!*******************************************************************************
!
!! BOUNDARY_TYPE determines the type of boundary conditions imposed.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    On input, the calling program has already determined the "type"
!    of every node (vertex or midside), and whether or not it lies
!    on the boundary.
!
!    The program has also set up an initial guess for the boundary
!    conditions, by setting every boundary node to have Dirichlet
!    conditions for U and V, and by setting a single vertex boundary
!    node to have Dirichlet boundary conditions for P.
!
!    The user is free to adjust these boundary conditions in any
!    reasonable way.  
!
!    The most obvious adjustment is to change some velocity boundary
!    conditions to Neumann conditions.  Keep in mind that, for the moment, 
!    we are only supporting zero Neumann conditions.
!
!    However, it is also possible to constrain ANY variable, whether it
!    is on the boundary or not, or to UNCONSTRAIN any variable that
!    has been tentatively constrained.  You simply have to "warn" the code,
!    by setting U_TYPE, V_TYPE or P_TYPE appropriately, and by supplying
!    a value for the right hand side if you are doing a Dirichlet condition.
!
!
!    For the channel flow, we intend for the Dirichlet boundary conditions 
!    to be applied on the inflow and horizontal walls, and zero Neumann
!    conditions on the outflow.
!
!    The calling program has already found the boundary, and guessed that
!    all boundary velocities are constrained by Dirichlet conditions.  So
!    we only have to switch the velocity variables on the outflow to
!    Neumann type.
!
!
!    The pressure is specified to be zero at a single node, but we let
!    the main program take care of that specification.
