      SUBANAGRAM <br> Program to Find Subanagrams
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SUBANAGRAM</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      creates a list of subanagrams of a master word;
      the user can require that the subanagrams be at least a given number
      of letters in length.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, given the minimum length requirement of 4 letters,
      and the master word <i>sprite</i>,
      there are as many as 85 subanagrams, including:
      <pre>
        ires
        pert
        pest
        pets
        pier
        piers
        pies
        ...(more)...
        tires
        tries
        trip
        tripe
        trips
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program simply opens a large "dictionary file" containing a list of words,
      and checks whether any word in the file matches the length requirement,
      and is a subanagram of the master word.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every word list has
      peculiarities, that is, it includes words that a user may reject,
      and it omits words that a user might have accepted.  Hence the output
      of this program is only a reasonable estimate of the subanagrams of
      a given word; a user must examine the list carefully and may find
      many words that need to be deleted, and may think of others that could
      be added.
    </p>

    <p>
      Textropolis is an iPhone application which presents you with the name
      of a city and asks for as many words as you can form, using only the
      letters in the city name.  It also wants the words to be at least
      4 letters long.  This program can be used to generate a list of
      candidate words for Textropolis's puzzles.  However, Textropolis's
      dictionary file is quite different from the one used by this program, so
      many words found by this program are rejected, and Textropolis
      allows some words unknown to the dictionary file used by this program.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>subanagram</b> <i>min_length</i> <i>master_word</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>min_length</i> is the minimum length (number of letters) allowed
          in any subanagram of the master word; 3, 4 or 5 are typical values;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>master_word</i> is the master word, which doesn't actually have
          to be a word, but which should contain no blanks.
        </li>
      </ul>
