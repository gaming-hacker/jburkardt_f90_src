      SUBSET_SUM <br> The Subset Sum Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SUBSET_SUM</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      seeks solutions of the subset sum problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      This function tries to compute a target value as the sum of
      a selected subset of a given set of weights.
    </p>

    <p>
      This function works by brute force, that is, it tries every
      possible subset to see if it sums to the desired value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given N weights, every possible selection can be described by
      one of the N-digit binary numbers from 0 to 2^N-1.
    </p>

    <p>
      This function includes a range, which allows the user to
      control which subsets are to be checked.  Thus, if there are
      N weights, specifying a range of [ 0, 2^N-1] indicates that
      all subsets should be checked.  On the other hand, this full
      range could be broken down into smaller subranges, each of
      which could be checked independently.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is possible that, in the given range, there may be multiple
      solutions of the problem.  This function will only return
      one such solution, if found.  However, the function may be called
      again, with an appropriate restriction of the range, to continue
      the search for other solutions.
