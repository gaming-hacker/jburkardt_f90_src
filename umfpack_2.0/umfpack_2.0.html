      UMFPACK_2.0 <br> Solution of Sparse Unsymmetric Linear Systems
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>UMFPACK_2.0</b>
      is a FORTRAN77 library which
      solves unsymmetric sparse linear systems,
      and represents an obsolete version of the program which
      has since been rewritten in C,
      by Timothy Davis, Iain Duff.
    </p>

    <p>
      UMFPACK Version 2.0 is a package for solving systems of sparse linear
      systems, Ax=b, where A is sparse and can be unsymmetric.  It is written
      in ANSI Fortran77.  There are options for choosing a good pivot order,
      factorizing a subsequent matrix with the same pivot order and nonzero
      pattern as a previously factorized matrix, and solving systems of linear
      equations with the factors (with A, L, or U, or their transposes). 
      Iterative refinement, with sparse backward error estimates, can be
      performed.  Both single and double precision routines are available.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are four primary routines that can be called by the user (where "*"
      is D for double precision or S for single precision):
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>UM*2IN:</b> sets the default the control parameters for 
          UM*2FA, UM*2RF, and UM*2SO.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>UM*2FA:</b> factors A into PAQ=LU, finding the pivot order (P and Q)
                based on both numerical and fill-reducing criteria.  This
                routine performs both symbolic and numerical factorization
                in a single step.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>UM*2RF:</b> factors A into PAQ=LU, using information (same P and Q and the
                same symbolic factorization) from a prior call to UM*2FA.
                Normally significantly faster than UM*2FA, since UM*2RF only
                performs numerical factorization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>UM*2SO:</b> solves a system of linear equations using the factors,
                optionally performing iterative refinement.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
